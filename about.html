                <h2 id=head1> LDL and HDL: What are they and How do they affect you?</h2>
                
                <h4>LDL ( Low Density Lipoprotein ) and HDL ( High Density Lipoprotein ) are molecules that help to carry and regulate the cholesterol in your body.
                LDL A.k.a bad cholesterol is the molecule that transports cholesterol to all of your cells that need them. Too much LDL can cause the cholesterol along with many other substances to build up in the your bodies arteries also called plaque build up.
                HDL A.k.a good cholesterol is beneficial for your body. It regulates the amount of cholesterol that is despearsed through out the body and it transports excess cholesterol to the liver to be expelled from the body. To much HDL can cause higher risk of heart diesease and stroke.

                <h2 id=head1>What are they made of?</h2>
                <h4>HDL and LDL are lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are complex particles composed of multiple proteins which transport all fat molecules (lipids) around the body within the water outside of the cells. All types of lipoproteins contain both lipids and proteins ( Lipoproteins). HDL and LDL have one main structural difference between them, and its the composition. Approx. 50% of the weight of an LDL particle is cholesteroland only 25 percent protein.
                HDL on the other hand is made up of only 25% cholesterol and 50% protein. Another more complex difference is that LDL contains B-100 and HDL contain A-1 and A-2. These are important because they determine the function of the lipoprotein.
