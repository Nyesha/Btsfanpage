                    BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, 
                is a seven-member South Korean boy band 
                formed by Big Hit Entertainment. 
                The name subsequently became an acronym for Beyond The Scene (but no one really calls them that anywas). 
                On June 13, 2013, they debuted with their title track "No More Dream" from their initial album 
                2 Cool 4 Skool. BTS rose to fame with their hottest comeback Blood, Sweat and Tears of their stuido album Wings in October of 2016.  
                Wings caught the attention of local and international fans alike. 
                After that they continued their success by relasing and album series titled Love Yourself which recently came to an end with the last album being Love Yourself: Answer.
                In the states they have made apperances on TV Shows (e.x The Ellen Show), Interviews and etc. BTS is labeled as one of the most important and sucessful groups to come out of K-pop. 
                Their fan base is a huge and contantly growing, with their charm, talent and good looks it isn't a surprise that they had such a successful year in music.</h2>
